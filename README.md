# Voice-to-Code Converter

## Project Overview  
This project aims to create a cross-platform mobile application that converts spoken programming logic into functional programming syntax. Using AI-powered language models, the app will process user-dictated instructions and generate equivalent code in functional programming languages such as Haskell, Lisp, or functional JavaScript/Python. The goal is to make coding more accessible, hands-free, and efficient for developers.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend & Mobile Development
- **Framework**: Flutter (Dart) or React Native (JavaScript/TypeScript)  
- **UI Design**: Material UI (Flutter) or ShadCN/UI (React Native)

### Backend & AI Processing
- **Speech-to-Text**: OpenAI Whisper, Google Speech-to-Text API, or Vosk  
- **AI Code Generation**: OpenAI Codex, GPT-4, or a custom fine-tuned LLM  
- **Database**: Firebase (for cloud storage) or MongoDB (for structured storage)  
- **Backend Framework**: Node.js with Express (if server-based processing is needed)

### Deployment & Hosting
- **Cloud Services**: Firebase, AWS, or Google Cloud  
- **App Store Deployment**: Google Play Store & Apple App Store
