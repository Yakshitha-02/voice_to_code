# Voice-to-Code Converter

## Project Overview  
This project aims to create a cross-platform mobile application that converts spoken programming logic into functional programming syntax. Using AI-powered language models, the app will process user-dictated instructions and generate equivalent code in functional programming languages such as Haskell, Lisp, or functional JavaScript/Python. The goal is to make coding more accessible, hands-free, and efficient for developers.
